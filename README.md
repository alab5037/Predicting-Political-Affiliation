# Classification Models to Examine Energy Politics                                                                             
I analyze whether a collection of 10 energy sources can determine if a state is red (voters predominantly in support of Republican Party) or blue (voters predominantly in support of Democratic Party) using two supervised learning models: logistic regression and random forest. The models achieve 86% and 80% accuracy, respectively.
