# Classification Models to Examine Energy Politics 

In recent years, climate change has polarized American politics. While there are numerous reports claiming that red states lead the renewables charge, others assert that republican lead states are too reliant on fossil fuels. Through multiple classification methods, I will ascertain whether a collection of 10 energy sources can determine if a state is red (voters predominantly in support of Republican Party) or blue (voters predominantly in support of Democratic Party). A successful model will reveal whether energy portfolios truly differ between red and blue states. Ultimately, the objective of this study is not to point fingers at any party. Instead, I hope that meaningful results lead to renewable energy proliferation.
