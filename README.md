# Classification Models to Examine Energy Politics                                                                             
I analyze whether a collection of 10 energy sources can determine if a state is red (voters predominantly in support of Republican Party) or blue (voters predominantly in support of Democratic Party) using three supervised learning models: logistic regression, random forest, and k-nearest neighbor. The models achieve 86%, 80%, and 83% accuracy, respectively.
