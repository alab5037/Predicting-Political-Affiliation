# Red or Blue
Through three classification methods, logistic regression, random forest, and linear discriminant analysis, I will ascertain whether a collection of 10 energy sources can determine if a state is red (voters predominantly in support of Republican Party) or blue (voters predominantly in support of Democratic Party). A successful model will reveal whether energy 
portfolios truly differ between red and blue states.
